## Appeal Point

Since I am a Backend lover guy, but I started loving working with nuxt.js frontend, which was completely new for me. But I love to learn new technology. But within 1 week time, I have to tried to learn basic things while working. Though I couln't complete most of the features asked to complete. If you extend the time , I would love to complete the rest.

2. JWT token authentication and authorization.
3. User information (e.g. name, followCount, followedCount)
4. register user feature implemted
5. In backend, "The user can follow other users".

## Unimplemented Features

* Timeline
  * List of Murmur information (e.g. text, LIKE count)
  * LIKE button each murmur.
  * Show 10 murmur per page. (need to implement pagination)
  
* Murmur Detail
  * Murmur Information (e.g. text, LIKE count)

## Impressions for this testing

* Instruction and other
  * Instead db, I have used typeorm
